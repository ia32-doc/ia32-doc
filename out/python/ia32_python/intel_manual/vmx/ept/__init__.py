@brief The extended page-table mechanism

The extended page-table mechanism (EPT) is a feature that can be used to support the virtualization of physical
memory. When EPT is in use, certain addresses that would normally be treated as physical addresses (and used to
access memory) are instead treated as guest-physical addresses. Guest-physical addresses are translated by
traversing a set of EPT paging structures to produce physical addresses that are used to access memory.
