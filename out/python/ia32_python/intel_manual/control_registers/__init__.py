@brief Control registers

Control registers (CR0, CR1, CR2, CR3, and CR4) determine operating mode of the processor and
the characteristics of the currently executing task. These registers are 32 bits in all 32-bit modes and compatibility
mode.

In 64-bit mode, control registers are expanded to 64 bits. The MOV CRn instructions are used to manipulate the
register bits. Operand-size prefixes for these instructions are ignored. The following is also true:

- The control registers can be read and loaded (or modified) using the move-to-or-from-control-registers forms
  of the MOV instruction. In protected mode, the MOV instructions allow the control registers to be read or loaded
  (at privilege level 0 only). This restriction means that application programs or operating-system procedures
  (running at privilege levels 1, 2, or 3) are prevented from reading or loading the control registers.

- Bits 63:32 of CR0 and CR4 are reserved and must be written with zeros. Writing a nonzero value to any of the
  upper 32 bits results in a general-protection exception, \#GP(0).

- All 64 bits of CR2 are writable by software.

- Bits 51:40 of CR3 are reserved and must be 0.

- The MOV CRn instructions do not check that addresses written to CR2 and CR3 are within the linear-address or
  physical-address limitations of the implementation.

- Register CR8 is available in 64-bit mode only.
  The control registers are summarized below, and each architecturally defined control field in these control registers
  is described individually.

- CR0  Contains system control flags that control operating mode and states of the processor.

- CR1  Reserved.

- CR2  Contains the page-fault linear address (the linear address that caused a page fault).

- CR3  Contains the physical address of the base of the paging-structure hierarchy and two flags (PCD and
  PWT). Only the most-significant bits (less the lower 12 bits) of the base address are specified; the lower 12 bits
  of the address are assumed to be 0. The first paging structure must thus be aligned to a page (4-KByte)
  boundary. The PCD and PWT flags control caching of that paging structure in the processors internal data
  caches (they do not control TLB caching of page-directory information).
  When using the physical address extension, the CR3 register contains the base address of the page-directorypointer
  table. In IA-32e mode, the CR3 register contains the base address of the PML4 table.

- CR4  Contains a group of flags that enable several architectural extensions, and indicate operating system or
  executive support for specific processor capabilities.

- CR8  Provides read and write access to the Task Priority Register (TPR). It specifies the priority threshold
  value that operating systems use to control the priority class of external interrupts allowed to interrupt the
  processor. This register is available only in 64-bit mode. However, interrupt filtering continues to apply in
  compatibility mode.

When the EM flag is set, execution of an x87 FPU instruction generates a device-not-available exception

Also, when the EM flag is set, execution of an MMX instruction causes an invalid-opcode exception (\#UD)

- If the EM flag is set, the setting of the TS flag has no effect on the execution of x87

  The processor does not automatically save the context of the x87 FPU, XMM, and MXCSR registers on a
