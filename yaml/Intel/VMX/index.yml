        - The low 16 bits correspond to bits 23:8 of the upper 32 bits of a 64-bit segment descriptor. While bits
          19:16 of code-segment and data-segment descriptors correspond to the upper 4 bits of the segment
          limit, the corresponding bits (bits 11:8) are reserved in this VMCS field.

        - Bit 16 indicates an unusable segment. Attempts to use such a segment fault except in 64-bit mode.
          In general, a segment register is unusable if it has been loaded with a null selector.

        - Bits 31:17 are reserved.
      note: |
        There are a few exceptions to this statement. For example, a segment with a non-null selector may be unusable following a task
        switch that fails after its commit point. In contrast, the TR register
        is usable after processor reset despite having a null selector

          in effect. Clearing this bit does not imply that NMIs are not (temporarily) blocked for other
          reasons.
          If the “virtual NMIs” VM-execution control is 1, this bit does not control the
          blocking of NMIs. Instead, it refers to “virtual-NMI blocking” (the fact that guest software is not
