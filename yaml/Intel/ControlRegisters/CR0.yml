  - Bit: 0
    ShortName: PE
    LongName: PROTECTION_ENABLE
    ShortDescription: Protection Enable
    LongDescription: |
      Enables protected mode when set; enables real-address mode when
      clear. This flag does not enable paging directly. It only enables segment-level protection. To enable paging,
      both the PE and PG flags must be set.

  - Bit: 1
    ShortName: MP
    LongName: MONITOR_COPROCESSOR
    ShortDescription: Monitor Coprocessor
    LongDescription: |
      Controls the interaction of the WAIT (or FWAIT) instruction with
      the TS flag (bit 3 of CR0). If the MP flag is set, a WAIT instruction generates a device-not-available exception
      (#NM) if the TS flag is also set. If the MP flag is clear, the WAIT instruction ignores the setting of the TS flag.

  - Bit: 2
    ShortName: EM
    LongName: EMULATE_FPU
    ShortDescription: FPU Emulation
    LongDescription: |
      Indicates that the processor does not have an internal or external x87 FPU
      when set; indicates an x87 FPU is present when clear. This flag also affects the execution of
      MMX/SSE/SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3/SSE4 instructions.

      When the EM flag is set, execution of an x87 FPU instruction generates a device-not-available exception
      (#NM). This flag must be set when the processor does not have an internal x87 FPU or is not connected to
      an external math coprocessor. Setting this flag forces all floating-point instructions to be handled by software
      emulation.

      Also, when the EM flag is set, execution of an MMX instruction causes an invalid-opcode exception (#UD)
      to be generated. Thus, if an IA-32 or Intel 64 processor incorporates MMX technology, the
      EM flag must be set to 0 to enable execution of MMX instructions.
      Similarly for SSE/SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3/SSE4 extensions, when the EM flag is set, execution of most
      SSE/SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3/SSE4 instructions causes an invalid opcode exception (#UD) to be generated.
      If an IA-32 or Intel 64 processor incorporates the SSE/SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3/SSE4 extensions,
      the EM flag must be set to 0 to enable execution of these extensions. SSE/SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3/SSE4
      instructions not affected by the EM flag include: PAUSE, PREFETCHh, SFENCE, LFENCE, MFENCE, MOVNTI,
      CLFLUSH, CRC32, and POPCNT.

  - Bit: 3
    ShortName: TS
    LongName: TASK_SWITCHED
    ShortDescription: Task Switched
    LongDescription: |
      Allows the saving of the x87 FPU/MMX/SSE/SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3/SSE4
      context on a task switch to be delayed until an x87 FPU/MMX/SSE/SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3/SSE4 instruction is
      actually executed by the new task. The processor sets this flag on every task switch and tests it when
      executing x87 FPU/MMX/SSE/SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3/SSE4 instructions.

      - If the TS flag is set and the EM flag (bit 2 of CR0) is clear, a device-not-available exception (#NM) is
        raised prior to the execution of any x87 FPU/MMX/SSE/SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3/SSE4 instruction; with the
        exception of PAUSE, PREFETCHh, SFENCE, LFENCE, MFENCE, MOVNTI, CLFLUSH, CRC32, and POPCNT.

      - If the TS flag is set and the MP flag (bit 1 of CR0) and EM flag are clear, an #NM exception is not raised
        prior to the execution of an x87 FPU WAIT/FWAIT instruction.

      - If the EM flag is set, the setting of the TS flag has no effect on the execution of x87
        FPU/MMX/SSE/SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3/SSE4 instructions.

        The processor does not automatically save the context of the x87 FPU, XMM, and MXCSR registers on a
        task switch. Instead, it sets the TS flag, which causes the processor to raise an #NM exception whenever
        it encounters an x87 FPU/MMX/SSE/SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3/SSE4 instruction in the instruction stream for the
        new task (with the exception of the instructions listed above).

        The fault handler for the #NM exception can then be used to clear the TS flag (with the CLTS instruction)
        and save the context of the x87 FPU, XMM, and MXCSR registers. If the task never encounters an x87
        FPU/MMX/SSE/SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3/SSE4 instruction, the x87 FPU/MMX/SSE/SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3/SSE4
        context is never saved.

  - Bit: 4
    ShortName: ET
    LongName: EXTENSION_TYPE
    ShortDescription: Extension Type
    LongDescription: |
      Reserved in the Pentium 4, Intel Xeon, P6 family, and Pentium processors.
      In the Pentium 4, Intel Xeon, and P6 family processors, this flag is hardcoded to 1. In the Intel386
      and Intel486 processors, this flag indicates support of Intel 387 DX math coprocessor instructions when
      set.

  - Bit: 5
    ShortName: NE
    LongName: NUMERIC_ERROR
    ShortDescription: Numeric Error
    LongDescription: |
      Enables the native (internal) mechanism for reporting x87 FPU errors
      when set; enables the PC-style x87 FPU error reporting mechanism when clear. When the NE flag is clear
      and the IGNNE# input is asserted, x87 FPU errors are ignored. When the NE flag is clear and the IGNNE#
      input is deasserted, an unmasked x87 FPU error causes the processor to assert the FERR# pin to generate
      an external interrupt and to stop instruction execution immediately before executing the next waiting
      floating-point instruction or WAIT/FWAIT instruction.

      The FERR# pin is intended to drive an input to an external interrupt controller (the FERR# pin emulates the
      ERROR# pin of the Intel 287 and Intel 387 DX math coprocessors). The NE flag, IGNNE# pin, and FERR#
      pin are used with external logic to implement PC-style error reporting. Using FERR# and IGNNE# to handle
      floating-point exceptions is deprecated by modern operating systems; this non-native approach also limits
      newer processors to operate with one logical processor active.

    ShortName: WP
    LongName: WRITE_PROTECT
    ShortDescription: Write Protect
    LongDescription: |
      When set, inhibits supervisor-level procedures from writing into readonly
      pages; when clear, allows supervisor-level procedures to write into read-only pages (regardless of the
      U/S bit setting). This flag facilitates implementation of the copy-onwrite
      method of creating a new process (forking) used by operating systems such as UNIX.

  - Bit: 18
    ShortName: AM
    LongName: ALIGNMENT_MASK
    ShortDescription: Alignment Mask
    LongDescription: |
      Enables automatic alignment checking when set; disables alignment
      checking when clear. Alignment checking is performed only when the AM flag is set, the AC flag in the
      EFLAGS register is set, CPL is 3, and the processor is operating in either protected or virtual-8086 mode.

  - Bit: 29
    ShortName: NW
    LongName: NOT_WRITE_THROUGH
    ShortDescription: Not Write-through
    LongDescription: |
      When the NW and CD flags are clear, write-back (for Pentium 4,
      Intel Xeon, P6 family, and Pentium processors) or write-through (for Intel486 processors) is enabled for
      writes that hit the cache and invalidation cycles are enabled.

  - Bit: 30
    ShortName: CD
    LongName: CACHE_DISABLE
    ShortDescription: Cache Disable
    LongDescription: |
      When the CD and NW flags are clear, caching of memory locations for
      the whole of physical memory in the processor’s internal (and external) caches is enabled. When the CD
      flag is set, caching is restricted. To prevent the processor from accessing and
      updating its caches, the CD flag must be set and the caches must be invalidated so that no cache hits can
      occur.

  - Bit: 31
    ShortName: PG
    LongName: PAGING_ENABLE
    ShortDescription: Paging Enable
    LongDescription: |
      Enables paging when set; disables paging when clear. When paging is
      disabled, all linear addresses are treated as physical addresses. The PG flag has no effect if the PE flag (bit
      0 of register CR0) is not also set; setting the PG flag when the PE flag is clear causes a general-protection
      exception (#GP).

      On Intel 64 processors, enabling and disabling IA-32e mode operation also requires modifying CR0.PG.
