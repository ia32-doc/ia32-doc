  description: |
    Exceptions that can occur when the instruction is executed in protected mode.

    Each exception is given a mnemonic that consists of a pound
    sign (#) followed by two letters and an optional error code in parentheses. For example, #GP(0) denotes a general
    protection exception with an error code of 0.
