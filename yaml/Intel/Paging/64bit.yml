  short_description: 64-Bit (4-Level) Paging
  long_description: |
    A logical processor uses 4-level paging if CR0.PG = 1, CR4.PAE = 1, and IA32_EFER.LME = 1. With 4-level paging,
    linear address are translated using a hierarchy of in-memory paging structures located using the contents of CR3.
    4-level paging translates 48-bit linear addresses to 52-bit physical addresses. Although 52 bits corresponds to 4
    PBytes, linear addresses are limited to 48 bits; at most 256 TBytes of linear-address space may be accessed at any
    given time.

    4-level paging uses a hierarchy of paging structures to produce a translation for a linear address. CR3 is used to
    locate the first paging-structure, the PML4 table. Use of CR3 with 4-level paging depends on whether processcontext
    identifiers (PCIDs) have been enabled by setting CR4.PCIDE.
